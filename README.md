### Hiya\! 😊 I'm Apirak Panatkool (Bank).

Just a UX Lead trying my best to make the world a little bit better, one user experience at a time\! 💖 I'm also the founder of **DealDroid**, which is like a little AI friend I'm building.

I've always believed that great work happens because everyone helps out, not just the designers\! 🙏

### A little bit about my journey so far...

  - **Falling in love with user problems:** I love meeting and understanding people's problems to find the right solution for them\! 🔎
  - **Helping teams find their UX superpowers:** I have so much fun being a coach and facilitator, helping teams discover their own design potential\! 🚀
  - **Bridging the gap:** I love connecting designers and developers, kind of like a small bridge that makes working together so much smoother\! 🌉

### My Little Toolbox 🛠️

  - **Playful Design:** Figma, Sketch ✨
  - **Thoughtful Methods:** User Research, Design Thinking, UX Strategy
  - **Just a bit of Code:** Javascript, Ruby on Rails (I'm always learning more\!) 🤓
